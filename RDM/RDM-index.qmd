## An apealing context: Reproducibility/ethical crisis in science

Science faces a reproducibility and ethical crisis that post significant
threats to the credibility of scientific research and the management of
public funds. Over the last decades, a growing body of evidence has
demonstrated that many research findings irreproducible, which calls
into question the transparency, integrity, and rigor of the scientific
process itself.

Reproducibility refers to the ability of independent researchers to
reproduce (using the same methods) published scientific results. It is a
cornerstone of scientific rigor, ensuring that findings are robust and
not the result of chance, bias, or methodological errors. However,
several high-profile studies have highlighted the alarming situation.
For instance, the Reproducibility Project in psychology revealed that
only 39% of 100 experimental studies could be successfully replicated
[@estimati2015].

Years before, in 2012, Begley and Ellis reported that only 11% of
preclinical studies in cancer could be reproduced. This indicated that
biomedical findings are not be as reliable as the public (and
researchers) think [@begley2012]. Nonetheless, this circumstance is not
confined to specific disciplines but is a systematic problem widespread
across the whole scientific world.

# Where does this crisis come from?

This a a multifactor crisis that include malpractices at different
levels. For instance, we can enumerate:

1.  **Publication Bias:** Just (misnamed) positive results are
    published, skewing the scientific literature toward artificial
    findings.

2.  **P-Hacking and data manipulation\>** Many researchers manipulate
    their data or statistical analyses to produce (once more misnamed)
    significant results due to the (illogically entrenched) pressure to
    publish/secure funding.

3.  **Lack of transparency and selective reporting:** When scientists
    selectively share certain data and hide other non-convenient results
    that that run counter to the story they want to tell.

4.  **Incompetence in research design and statistical analysis:**
    Believe it or not, most scientists are incompetent in analyzing
    their data and setup proper research designs.

These and other issues exacerbates the crisis of reproducibility and
call for pertinent actions to return to doing valuable science and not
science focused on constructing convenient stories to inflate curricula
and obtain academic promotions.

# Research data management is the way

The Role of Research Data Management (RDM) practices are crucial to
addressing the reproducibility and ethical crisis modernen science faces
[@munaf√≤2017]. Endrosing effective RDM pratices promotes transparency,
well-organized research data, and open sharing with the community. Some key
RDM strategies include:

- **Data Documentation and Metadata** to ensure datasets are appropriately understandable 
- **Version Control and Data Provenance** to track changes in
data over time and maintaining a clear record of its origin and
modifications.
- **Open Data Practices** to encourage the sharing of data,
software, and protocols through repositories and open-access platforms.
